# How to Contribute

Let's try to stick to sircmpwn's [coding style]

And write [commit messages] like so, keeping the top line to this sort of syntax:

```
cursor: add special feature
```

[coding style]: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/cstyle
[commit messages]: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages
