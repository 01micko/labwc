# How to Contribute

Let's try to stick to sircmpwn's [coding style]

If you're not used to it, you can use [checkpatch.pl] to run a few simple formatting checks.

Write [commit messages] like so, keeping the top line to this sort of syntax:

```
cursor: add special feature
```

And please wrap the main commit message at max 74 characters, otherwise `git log` and similar look so weird.
